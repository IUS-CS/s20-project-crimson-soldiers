For anyone needing information regarding Indiana University Southeast services and/or offices,  
this web-based service will act as a search engine providing location, hours, phone number,  
email, and description. This will help faculty, students, and even visitors needing to get  
more information quickly in one place for all IUS services. Unlike another service somewhat  
similar, the focus is on services specifically at IUS, so every other IU campus is not included. 

There will be a home page with a search option for the current services and offices available at IUS. The following page will then show titled results and brief descriptions with a logo. Once the correct option is found and selected, the final page will show further information including all available contact info and an option to return to the home page for another easy search.

This site will be using ASP.NET Web API for the back-end framework along with Angular for the front-end. The package bundler used is the Angular CLI. With that being said, the primary programming language used is TypeScript. Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer will be the object-relation mapping framework. Swagger will be the web API testing tool.
