For anyone needing information regarding Indiana University Southeast services and/or offices,  
this web-based service will act as a search engine providing location, hours, phone number,  
email, and description. This will help faculty, students, and even visitors needing to get  
more information quickly in one place for all IUS services. Unlike another service somewhat  
similar, the focus is on services specifically at IUS, so every other IU campus is not included.
