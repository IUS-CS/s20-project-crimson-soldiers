We are utilizing a Singleton to get requested information from the database to the end user, this is because we want one set of information for all users.  
The Command design pattern allows us to take HTTPS requests and take some action on them.  
Dependency injection separates the creation of the services away from the client and onto the webapp.  
Repositories allow us to abstract the queries to the database from the request created by the user.
