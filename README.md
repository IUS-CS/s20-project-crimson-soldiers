# s20-project-crimson-soldiers
The **s20-project-crimson-soldiers** is for anyone needing information regarding Indiana University  
Southeast services and/or offices, this web-based service will act as a search engine providing  
location, hours, phone number,email, and description. This will help faculty, students, and even  
visitors needing to get more information quickly in one place for all IUS services. Unlike another  
service somewhat similar, the focus is on services specifically at IUS, so every other IU campus is  
not included.
